# Air Quality Forecast in USA
## Problem Statement: 
* Air pollution is one of the most serious problems in the world. It refers to the contamination of the atmosphere by harmful chemicals or biological materials. 
* Air pollution can cause long-term and short-term health effects. It's found that the elderly and young children are more affected by air pollution. Short-term health effects include eye, nose, and throat irritation, headaches, allergic reactions, and upper respiratory infections. Some long-term health effects are lung cancer, brain damage, liver damage, kidney damage, heart disease, and respiratory disease. 
## Project Description: 
This project is about the Exploratory Data Analysis of the Air Quality across states in USA using Pyspark. From the year 2000 through 2021, this dataset contains daily statistics on four important gas pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ground-level ozone, and sulfur dioxide.
## Keywords in the Dataset:
* Ozone molecule (O3) is harmful to air quality outside of the ozone layer.
* Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be harmful when inhaled in large amounts. 
* Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a colorless, reactive air pollutant with a strong odor. This gas can be a threat to human health, animal health, and plant life.
* Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a gaseous air pollutant composed of nitrogen and oxygen and is one of a group of related gases called nitrogen oxides.
* Air Quality Index (AQI)  is used for reporting daily air quality. It tells us how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for us. 
The more the AQI the worse is the quality of air.
