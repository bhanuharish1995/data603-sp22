# Neo4j Fabric Sharding
Neo4j is one of the most popular graph databases that gives developers and data scientists the most authorized and refined tools to quickly build todayâ€™s intelligent applications and smart workflows. Neo4j is increasingly being used as the basis for production analytic and machine learning use cases in problems like fraud detection and real-time recommendations.

Neo4j database has a hard limit in terms of scalability since it essentially was restricted to running on a single server. With the launch of Neo4j 4.0, it has implemented a graph sharding approach called Fabric to support distributing data across instances or systems. It provides the capability of both accessing data in separate graphs, as well as a connected graph stretched across multiple partitions/databases.
